,,,Waste Volume =,210 gals,,,,,,Provided by Vacuum Truck Movement Contractor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Water fracion=,99%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Aqueous Waste Quantity=,210 gals * 99% * 8.34 lb/gal * 1 (SG) / 2.2 (lbs/kg) =,,,,786 (Kg/Qtr),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Organic Waste Quantity=,210 gals * (1-(99%/100%)) * 1 (SG) * 8.34 (lbs/gal) / 2.2 (lbs/kg) =,,,,0 (Kg/Qtr),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,Benzene Quantity Calculation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Aqueous Benzene Concentration=,24 ppm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Organic Benzene Concentration=,2400 ppm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Aqueous Benzene Quantity=,24 ppm * 786 (Kg/Qtr) /1000000 =,,,0.02 (Kg/Qtr),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Organic Benzene Quantity=,2400 ppm * 0 (Kg/Qtr) /1000000=,,,0.02 (Kg/Qtr),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Total Benzene Quantity =,0.02 (Kg/Qtr) + 0.02 (Kg/Qtr) = ,,,0 (Mg/Qtr),Waste Quantity * Density * Benzene Concentration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Information based on vacuum truck movements provided by vacuum truck movement operators (PSC) during the year 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Benzene concentrations for the aqueous and organic phase were assigned based on product description and product source details. Note that Aqueous and Organic Materials are sometime different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
